All of the cases are in the Study.Net reader. All are required reading and students should be prepared to discuss them in class.\n\nThis is your chance to decide as a team which case you want to focus on for the Case Preparation & Leadership Assignment. Two teams will be responsible for: (1) leading the class discussion of the key issues in the case, (2) writing a 3 page recap of their findings and recommendations, and (3) posting and monitoring a discussion board thread about the aspect of the case they are focusing on. One team will tackle the case from a company/competitive perspective and the other from a customer/consumer point of view.\n\nClick here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAx2ONcz6CF1ghWfKD8t6iBEygSTZaikBwqak3Iy22MedhSg/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=113674834595072819528) to see the questions to be addressed by the team responsible for our discussion of each case. Then, agree as a team on your top 3 choices and fill out this short preferences survey (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAx2ONcz6CF1ghWfKD8t6iBEygSTZaikBwqak3Iy22MedhSg/viewform?usp=header). After submitting your response, have one team member upload the confirmation page to bCourses.\n\nTeams will be assigned a case if they do not submit their preferences by Friday, Oct 17.\n\nDue: Friday Oct 17 by 11:59pm\nPoints: 0\nAvailable: Oct 8 at 12am - Oct 17 at 11:59pm",

This person will be responsible for 1) preparing in advance by reviewing the process and objectives for each stage and pulling up the top three agreements from Check-In #1, 2) guiding the team through the entire workshop, 3) ensuring communication during the workshop is balanced (i.e., everyone has an opportunity to share and listen), 4) supporting the team in reaching 1-3 joint agreements in support of your team’s continued development and 5) uploading a photo of the Collaborative Map to bCourse by 10/24.  \n\nSupplies:\n\n* For an in-person check-in, teams will need a large whiteboard or easel pad, sticky notes, and markers. Kits with the needed supplies will be available in the MBA Lounge. Please return the kits to the lounge after using them so other teams can use them. \n\n* For a virtual check-in, teams can use the Zoom whiteboard function to create a collaborative map to support your brainstorming & discussion. \n\nResources:\n\n* [Check-In Video:] (https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1546457/pages/video-team-check-in) Refresher on the purpose of a Team Check-In.\n\n* [Self-Facilitated Check-In Deck:] (https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1546457/files/92053866?wrap=1) Provides detailed facilitation instructions\n\n* [Note:] (https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1546457/files/92053931?wrap=1) An Overview of Giving and Receiving Reflective Feedback in Teams\n\nSubmission\n\n* Photo of Collaborative Map with Team Agreements (1/team)",

All of the cases are in the Study.Net reader. All are required reading and students should be prepared to discuss them in class.\n\nThis is your chance to decide as a team which case you want to focus on for the Case Preparation & Leadership Assignment. Two teams will be responsible for: (1) leading the class discussion of the key issues in the case, (2) writing a 3 page recap of their findings and recommendations, and (3) posting and monitoring a discussion board thread about the aspect of the case they are focusing on. One team will tackle the case from a company/competitive perspective and the other from a customer/consumer point of view.\n\nClick here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAx2ONcz6CF1ghWfKD8t6iBEygSTZaikBwqak3Iy22MedhSg/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=113674834595072819528) to see the questions to be addressed by the team responsible for our discussion of each case. Then, agree as a team on your top 3 choices and fill out this short preferences survey (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAx2ONcz6CF1ghWfKD8t6iBEygSTZaikBwqak3Iy22MedhSg/viewform?usp=header).

This person will be responsible for 1) preparing in advance by reviewing the process and objectives for each stage and pulling up the top three agreements from Check-In #1, 2) guiding the team through the entire workshop, 3) ensuring communication during the workshop is balanced (i.e., everyone has an opportunity to share and listen), 4) supporting the team in reaching 1-3 joint agreements in support of your team’s continued development and 5) uploading a photo of the Collaborative Map to bCourse by 10/24.  \n\nSupplies:\n\n* For an in-person check-in, teams will need a large whiteboard or easel pad, sticky notes, and markers. Kits with the needed supplies will be available in the MBA Lounge. Please return the kits to the lounge after using them so other teams can use them. \n\n* For a virtual check-in, teams can use the Zoom whiteboard function to create a collaborative map to support your brainstorming & discussion. \n\nResources:\n\n* [Check-In Video:] (https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1546457/pages/video-team-check-in) Refresher on the purpose of a Team Check-In.\n\n* [Self-Facilitated Check-In Deck:] (https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1546457/files/92053866?wrap=1) Provides detailed facilitation instructions\n\n* [Note:] (https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1546457/files/92053931?wrap=1) An Overview of Giving and Receiving Reflective Feedback in Teams\n\nSubmission\n\n* Photo of Collaborative Map with Team Agreements (1/team)",
